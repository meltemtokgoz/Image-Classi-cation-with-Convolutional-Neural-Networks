All my .py file codes are in the folder named code.
The layout between the .py files is as follows.

-code
	-part1.py
	-part1.ipynb
	-part2_3.py
	-part2_3.ipynb

Note:
I've added my code as a .py and .ipynb file. (Two files with the same name have the same code.)
	
Dataset layout

-dataset
	-train
	-validation
	-test
	
As the names indicate, each part's code is independent of each other and works separately.
With direct run can run every .py file.
It can be operated with direct run button without needing an extra parameter.
The functions used are described in detail in the report.

Implementation Info

I've used Python 3.5 also I wrote my code in Colab

I'm reading all the images in the code from a folder called  "dataset"  
and printing the results to the console.
